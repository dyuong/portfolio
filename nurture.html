<div class="hypothesis">
        <div class="hypothesis-title">Hypothesis</div>
        <div>Our group hypothesised that since COVID, an increasing number of plant-growers are struggling to keep their plants healthy in their households. 
            We experienced this personally as a group, and were interested to see if this was the case amongst other people as well.  </div>
        <br>
        Our group set out to conduct both qualitative and quantitative research methods to try and determine whether this was the case.

        <div class="interview-content">Our group completed 6 one-to-one interviews with plant owners, with the aim of discovering the pain points associated with plant care.
            <br><br>
            We then categorized the data using an affinity diagram to get a better picture of the data collected.</div>

            Some key research data we found from the surveys were:
        <ul>
            <li>20 out of 21 respondents (95%) report they would benefit from added guidance in looking after their plant</li>
            <li>10 out of 21 respondents (47%) report themselves as having poor or very poor knowledge in the conditions best suited for their plants.</li>
            <li>8 out of 21 respondents (39%) reporting themselves as poor or very poor at looking after their plant</li>

            Completing this analysis we realised that the market was already quite saturated, so our focus switched to improving some of the current weaknesses of apps on the market.

            We also constructed user flows for the main features in our app, allowing us to visualise the ideal pathway we wanted our users to undertake.

            This step also allowed us to identify any potential pain points users may encounter in the pathway, and resolve this prior to commencing our designs.
