        <div style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:1%">Hypothesised Problem</div>
        <div>With the idea of developing a travel itinerary app, I had hypothesised that people have difficulty documenting and changing their travel itinerary. I also hypthesised that people may want an easier way to plan their itinerary with their fellow travellers without having to constantly meet up online. 
        
        <br><Br>
        So it was time to conduct research to test my hypotheses, and to see if other people experienced similar pain points when creating their travel itienary.
        I utilised both qualitative and quantitative research methods in order to achieve this, with the summary of my research displayed below.
        </div>    
    </div>
    <div class="interviews">
        <div style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:1%"> Interviews</div>
        <div style>I conducted 6 one-to-one interviews with people who have traveled in the past. The objective of the interview was to understand the pain points people experienced when planning their trips. 
        <br><br>
        I collated the data onto sticky notes, and then categorized the data through an affinity diagram to get a better picture of the data collected.

            <div style>I also conducted a survey which was completed by 17 participants. Some of the key findings are displayed below.

    <div class="define-intro">
        <div style="font-size:36px; font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:1%"> Define</div>
        <div>After looking at the research, a few key insights came across: </div>    
    </div>
    <div style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold; margin-top:2%; color:#862ECC"> User Insights</div>
    <div class="user-insights">
        <div>
            People prefer to work on the itinerary in their own time<br><br>
            People find it difficult to keep track of changes to their itinerary <br><br>
            People find it stressful when changes are made to the itinerary
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="define-intro" style="margin-top:3%">
        <div>The insights and data generally supported my hypothesis - people found keeping track of the itinerary could be difficult (especially when there were changes), and that people found it easier to work on the itinerary in their own time. 
        It also showcased how different people were when it came to planning; some people were extremely detailed and structured, whilst others were spontaneous and flexible.
        </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="define-intro" style="margin-top:5%">
        <div style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:1%"> User Persona</div>   
        <div> From the research, I was also able to define a user persona to represent my target audience.</div>

<div class="define-intro" style="margin-top: 5%">
Lastly, I defined two main problems that my mobile app was to try and solve:
</div>
<div style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold; margin-top:3%; color:#0054E6"> Problem Statement </div>
<div class="problem-statement">
    How might we ensure that users can easily document and keep track of changes to their itinerary? <br><br>

        <div>After defining personas and a problem statement, it was time to generate ideas for my itinerary planning mobile app. 
            <br><br>
            I started by completing a comparative analysis with other itinerary-planning apps in the market, which allowed me to determine any market gaps to capitalise on. This step also served as an inspiration for features for my app to include, as well as the overall look and feel of my eventual design.

    <div class="ideate-intro" style="margin-top:5%; margin-bottom: 5%">Lastly, I created some user flows for key features my mobile app was to include, based off the insights I had gained through my research. This step also served as a basis for my initial wireframes.</div>

<div class="prototype-intro" style="margin-top: 5%;">After designing my initial wireframes, it was time to do some usability testing to help validate my concepts. 
    Users were asked to work through the main features of the app, and comment on any pain points that they encountered. <br><br>
        I completed 6 usability tests in total, with some of the feedback being displayed below:

<div class="prototype-intro" style="margin-top: 5%;"> After completing my higher fidelity designs, I conducted another round of usability testing, this time with 5 users. <br> It was important to regularly conduct usability tests throughout the building process, as this allowed me to continually iterate and refine my designs to match my user’s needs and goals.

                        Ideally undergoing more extensive usability testing throughout the design process would have been ideal, but due to time limitations I wasn’t able to complete as much usability testing between iterations as I would have liked. 
                        <br><br>                        
                        Throughout this challenge, usability testing provided key feedback which guided future iterations - it really emphasised the importance or testing with potentially real users to keep the concept and designs aligned with user needs and expectations.

                    <div class="reflection-text"> 
                        Being a 3 week individual design challenge meant that I had to set realistic expectations of what I was going to try and achieve from the outset. 
                        <br><br>                        
                        Throughout this challenge I quickly learnt the importance of prioritising with regards to research methods, features I wanted to implement, and the overall look and feel of the high fidelity prototype. 
                        <br><br>
                        It also required me to think about what was really important to users, and to prioritise working on these things first.
