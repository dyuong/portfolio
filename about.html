            <div>Hi! I'm Daniel, a UX/UI designer and researcher based in Melbourne, Australia. </div>
            <div style="font-weight:800; margin-top:5%;">Why UX?</div>
            <div style="margin-top:3%;">What draws me to the work is the ability to be creative, understand and solve human problems, and to work within a team to deliver a high quality product. </div>
            <div style="margin-top:3%;">I was originally a physiotherapist, however found the work less fulfilling than I thought it would be. I found that the work, although interactive, was quite isolating.  I also had a strong desire to be more creative, and to work on projects with other people.</div>
            <div style="margin-top:3%;">Towards the end of 2022, I transitioned towards UX/UI Design. It felt as though I had found something that I enjoyed, and I continue to do so. </div>
            <div style="font-weight:800; margin-top:5%;">Outwide of work</div>
            <div style="margin-top:3%;">Outside of work, my life mainly consists of reading novels, watching anime, playing volleyball and spending time with friends and family.
                                        Although introverted, I enjoy spending time connecting and meeting with new people. </div>
